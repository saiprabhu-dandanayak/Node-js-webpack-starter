# Node.js Starter Application

The **"nodejs-starter-application"** is a boilerplate project setup for building robust server-side applications using Node.js. It provides a well-organized structure and essential configurations to accelerate development with a focus on scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Organize your code into controllers, services, models, and utilities for better separation of concerns.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight and flexible web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **Middleware**: Easily extend functionality with custom middleware for tasks such as authentication.
- **Database Integration**: Simple configuration for connecting to a database (mocked for demonstration purposes).
- **Babel**: Transpile modern JavaScript using Babel.
- **ESLint**: Lint your code to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes sample utilities for logging and other common tasks.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **`controllers/`**: Route handlers and logic.
  - **`models/`**: Database models and schemas.
  - **`routes/`**: API route definitions.
  - **`services/`**: Business logic and service integrations.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers.
  - **`middleware/`**: Custom middleware functions.
  - **`config/`**: Configuration files and settings.
  - **`index.js`**: The main entry point of the application.

- **`build/`**: Compiled files, if using a build process.
